# reason(ML) is language you have probably dreamed about
Facebook founded, multiparadigm, type safe language. There is a lot of reasons why it will replace javascript (typesript, flow) in at least React appps. Thanks to its implementation straight to special OS written in OCaml is blazing fast and can be used in backend, IoT devices, etc. Designers try to implement many features from web metalanguage straight to language itself, so you won't need babels, type configs, specific tooligns for refactorings.
